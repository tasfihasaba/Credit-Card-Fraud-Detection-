# Credit Card Fraud Detection

## Introduction
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques. The goal is to build a robust model that can accurately classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is from the Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset. It contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders. The dataset is highly imbalanced, with only 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions.

## Project Structure
- **data**: Contains the dataset (`creditcard.csv`).
- **notebooks**: Jupyter notebooks with data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- **models**: Serialized trained models.
- **src**: Source code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
